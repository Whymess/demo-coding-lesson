## **Use of Destructuring in React**

### What is Destructuring?

JavaScript uses objects to interact with complex data structure. There are hardly any JavaScript applications that do not use objects. Beginning with ES6, JavaScript implemented de-structuring, a new syntax that makes it easier to create variables from an objectâ€™s properties.    

Destructuring syntax in JavaScript lets developers conveniently extract data from arrays and objects and set them into new separate variables. Most importantly, destructuring also allows us to easily and concisely extract many properties simultaneously. Imagine trying to extract data from a nested array or object with 5 or 6 levels.


### Patterns for destructuring

All destructuring syntax has two distinct components.
1. Destructuring source: the data to be deconstructed, which is the right-hand side of the assignment.
2. Destructuring target: the variables used for destructuring, which is the left-hand side of the assignment.


### Objectives 
1. Learn how to extract value(s) from an object, using the destructuring syntax. 
2. Learn how to extract value(s) from an array, using the destructuring syntax.
3. Use your new skills and implement destructuring in a React component.
