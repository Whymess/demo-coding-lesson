1. Declare and assign an empty object using object notation.
   ` let yoni = {}`

2. Add two properties to the empty object.
   `let yoni = {occupation: "Software Developer", age: 33}`

3. Assign the newly created object to two variables. Be sure to wrap your newly created variables inside curly brackets.
   `let {occupation,age } = {occupation: "Software Developer", age: 33}`

4. Use console.log to print out the variables.
   `console.log({occupation,age })`
